<div class="on"><h3>WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ?<br><br>  </h3>Sustainable development is an organizing principle for meeting human development goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services on which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability goals, such as the current UN-level Sustainable Development Goals, address the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.</div>
<div class="os"><h3> LIFE ON LAND</h3><br>Sustaining life on land means preserving and restoring terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, grasslands, drylands and mountains by halting deforestation, fragmentation and overgrazing and reversing desertification and land degradation. Terrestrial ecosystems–comprising roughly 30 percent of the planet’s surface–provide us with sources of water, food, fuel, shelter and medicine, help mitigate carbon emissions and help us to adapt to the impact of changing climate. For example, more than 1.6 billion people directly depend on forest biodiversity and ecosystem services for their livelihoods, which also underpin the health and resilience of all our economies and societies.</div>
<div class="op"><h3>TARGETS</h3>
<div class="text10">
<ul>
<li>Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems</li>

<li>End deforestation and restore degraded forests</li>

<li>End desertification and restore degraded land</li>

<li>Protect biodiversity and natural habitats</li>

<li>Promote access to genetic resources and fair sharing of the benefits</li>

<li>Eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species</li>

<li>Prevent invasive alien species on land and in water ecosystems</li>

<li>Integrate ecosystem and biodiversity in governmental planning</li>

<div class="forestinclude1"><div class="headings">What is "Sustainably manage forests"</div><div class="text3">Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) is the management of forests according to the principles of sustainable development. Sustainable forest management must maintain a balance between three main pillars: environmental, economic and socio-cultural.<br><br>
Successful implementation of sustainable forest management will bring integrated benefits to all, from the protection of indigenous livelihoods to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests, to the reduction of rural poverty and the impact of climate change. Forest conservation is essential to stop climate change.

<div class="forestinclude1"><div class="headings">What is "Prevent desertification"</div><div class="text3">Desertification is land degradation that occurs in dry lands. Natural processes are triggered by human activity, where biological activity is lost or fertile areas become increasingly arid. It is the spread of arid areas caused by various factors such as climate change (especially current global warming)  and overuse of soil as a substitute for human activity.</div></div>
